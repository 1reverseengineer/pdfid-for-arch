# pdfid-bin
### Context
After attempting to search for a pdf analysis tool for a regular linux distro, it became clear that such a simple solution doesn't exist. Peepdf was using python2 and pdfid was a kali-package.
All that was done, was debtap the original kali-repo pdfid package and install it with pacman.

ArchLinux packaged version of the kali-linux pdf analyses tool pdfid. 

The original author of this awesome tool is, according to the kali-repo, DidierStevensSuite (https://github.com/DidierStevens/DidierStevensSuite).

I couldn't detect the proper license so I will simply say that **his license(s) apply!**

### Installation
Either run the pdfid executable in a terminal or install the zst package with sudo pacman -U filename.zst
